Problem 1
```{r}
bw_data=read.csv("birthweight.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex=recode(babysex, "1"="male", "2"="female"),
    frace=recode(frace, "1"="white", "2"="black", "3"="asian", "4"="puerto_rican", "8"="other", "9"="unknown"),
    malform=recode(malform, "0"="absent", "1"="present"),
    mrace=recode(mrace, "1"="white", "2"="black", "3"="asian", "4"="puerto_rican", "8"="other")
  )
colSums(is.na(bw_data)) 
# no missing data
```

```{r}
lm0_test = lm(bwt ~ ., data = bw_data)
step(lm0_test, direction = 'backward')
# using stepwise regression to choose model, and the model I choose including predictors: babysex, baby' s head circumference, baby's length and so on.
lm0 = lm(bwt ~ babysex + bhead + blength + delwt + fincome + gaweeks + mheight + mrace + parity + ppwt + smoken, data = bw_data)
summary(lm0)

bw_data %>% 
  add_predictions(model = lm0, var = "predict") %>% 
  add_residuals(model = lm0, var = "residual") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = predict, y = residual)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(color = "yellow") + 
  labs(title = "Model residuals against fitted values", 
       y = "Residuals",
       x = "Fitted Values"
       )
```

```{r}
cv_df=bw_data %>% 
  crossv_mc(100) %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble)) %>% 
  mutate(
    lm0=map(.x=train, ~lm(bwt ~ babysex + bhead + blength + delwt + fincome + gaweeks + mheight + mrace + parity + ppwt + smoken, data=.x)),
    lm1=map(.x=train, ~lm(bwt~blength+gaweeks, data=.x)),
    lm2=map(.x=train, ~lm(bwt~bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength+ blength*babysex + bhead*blength*babysex, data =.x)),
    rmse_lm0= map2_dbl(.x=lm0, .y=test, ~rmse(.x, .y)),
    rmse_lm1=map2_dbl(.x=lm1, .y=test, ~rmse(.x, .y)),
    rmse_lm2=map2_dbl(.x=lm2, .y=test, ~rmse(.x, .y))
  )

cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin()
```

From the figure we can see that the model that we fit has the lowest rmse, thereâ€™s clearly some improvement in predictive accuracy. The model with interacion performs worse than `lm0`, but still better than the model with only two predictors which does not take full advantage of the data.
